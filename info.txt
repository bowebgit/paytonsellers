8/13/17 The master branch builds and the .war runs if copied to apache webapps directory. Not sure
        how to add the structure to eclipse apache server. Don't know if using-jdbc or using-hibernate-jpa
        will run on apache server. I'm copying the master branch to an archive folder somewhere.
