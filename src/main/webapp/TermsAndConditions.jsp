	<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
	
<p>
User account
</p><p>
For safety and security, each customer is allowed to create 
only one registered account by default. For customers who attempt 
to create several accounts, we reserve the right to suspend accounts
 without further notice.</p><p>
Ordering</p><p>
Whilst all efforts are made to ensure accuracy of product descriptions,
 specifications and pricing there may be occasions where errors arise. 
 Should such a situation occur PaytonSellers cannot accept your order. In the 
 event of a mistake you will be contacted with a full explanation and a corrected offer. The information displayed is considered as an invitation to treat not as a confirmed offer for sale. The contract is confirmed upon supply of goods.
Given the popularity and/or supply constraints of some of our products, 
PaytonSellers may have to limit the number of products available for purchase.
 PaytonSellers reserves the right to change quantities available for purchase 
 at any time, even after you place an order.
Both parties agree that, following order dispatch, transportation is the 
sole responsibility of the third-party logistics company. During this stage, 
full ownership of the product(s) belongs to the buyer; all associated liability 
and risks during transportation shall be borne by the buyer.</p><p>
Order Cancelation</p><p>
Customers can cancel their order at anytime prior to shipping; please contact 
our Support Center. However, once the order has been dispatched, the order 
cannot be canceled, changed, or refunded. Upon receipt of the package, our 
Warranty and Return policy comes into effect.</p><p>
Shipping and Delivery</p><p>
Shipping ("ships in") times displayed on PaytonSellers refer to the estimated time 
it takes for packages to leave our hands. Since the actual delivery of your 
order can be impacted by many events beyond PaytonSellers's control once it leaves our facilities, PaytonSellers cannot be held liable for late deliveries. We will, however, work with you to ensure a smooth delivery.
There may be occasions when PaytonSellers confirms your order but subsequently 
learns that it cannot supply the ordered product. In the event we cannot 
supply a product you ordered in a timely fashion, PaytonSellers will contact 
customers and offer to cancel the order and refund purchase prices in full. 
We try to make the delivery process as simple as possible and we are able 
to send your order either to you home or to your work place. We can ship to 
PO Boxes via all shipping methods, except for Expedited Shipping because 
signatures are required upon delivery. Express shipments of this type can 
only be delivered to physical addresses.

Lunar New Year, please allow extra delivery time. During those special 
occasions we will provide notices to reflect possible delays.
PaytonSellers ships packages from Shenzhen, and operates a return address in 
Shenzhen.
Customers are responsible for providing complete and accurate shipping 
addresses. PaytonSellers cannot make changes to your shipping address once a 
package has been shipped, and PaytonSellers is not liable for packages lost 
due to incomplete or inaccurate addresses.
All orders reported as "delivered" by shipping companies are considered 
delivered. PaytonSellers cannot be made liable of non-delivery in this case.
Exchange and Returns (Money Back Guarantee)
If when you receive your product(s), you are not completely satisfied
 you may return the items to us, within 45 days for refund. Returns will 
 take approximately 5 working days for the process once the goods have arrived. 
 The precise length depends on the payment provider used (e.g. PayPal, credit 
 card company, etc). Items must be in their original packaging, all the original 
 boxes must be intact and included, along with all packaging materials, manuals, 
 blank warranty cards, plus all accessories and documents provided by the manufacturer.
You must first contact us and be in receipt of a return merchandise authorisation 
(RMA) number before sending any item back. Any product returned without a RMA number 
will not be refunded.
The money back guarantee does not cover volume/wholesale and customized orders.
Shipping back to PaytonSellers is paid for by the customer. We are in general unable 
to refund you postal fees.
Any product returned found not to be defective can be refunded within the time 
stated above. Goods found to be tampered with by the customer will not be replaced
 but returned at the customer's own expense.
By default, the refund amount cannot exceed the original order amount paid to
 PaytonSellers.</p><p>
Non-Returnable</p><p>
Discounted or end of line products can only be returned for repair. No refunds or 
replacements will be made.</p><p>
Incorrect/Damaged Goods</p><p>
We try very hard to ensure that you receive your order in pristine condition. If 
you do not receive the products ordered, please contact us. In the unlikely event 
that the product arrives damaged or faulty, please contact us immediately.</p><p>

free. From time to time there may be information on PaytonSellers that contains 
typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions that may relate to product descriptions,

We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or 
update information at any time without prior notice. If a key product specification is
 changed after you place an order or within seven days of delivery, you can cancel and 
 return the order for a full refund.</p><p>
Prices</p><p>
Prices and availability of items are subject to change without notice. The prices do 
not include import tax and duties, should your package become examined and deemed
